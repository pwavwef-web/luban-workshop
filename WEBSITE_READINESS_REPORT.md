# Luban Workshop Restaurant – Website Readiness Report

**Date:** May 2026 (updated)  
**Site:** [lubanrestaurant.com](https://lubanrestaurant.com)  
**Stack:** Static HTML · Firebase (Auth + Firestore) · Tailwind CSS (local build) · Google Analytics 4 · PWA

---

## Executive Summary

The Luban Workshop Restaurant website is **substantially ready for public use**. Core customer-facing flows (browse menu, place order, book a table, contact the restaurant) are all implemented and live, and the admin dashboard covers day-to-day operational needs. Since the initial audit, several previously flagged items have been resolved, including consistent opening hours, a custom 404 page, local Tailwind build output, Google Fonts preconnect hints, corrected About Us canonical URL, `about-us/profile.html` in the sitemap, populated JSON-LD `sameAs` links, PNG favicon/manifest icons, deployed production Firestore rules, migration away from compat Firebase CDN scripts, expanded Chinese page coverage, Cloud Functions email notifications for orders/reservations, SMS notifications (customer order confirmation and restaurant alert via Arkesel) with a status-update SMS when an order moves to "preparing" or "completed", and the Firebase Hosting site name (`luban-workshop-restaurant`) now explicitly configured in `firebase.json` for deterministic multi-site deployments. The remaining gaps are mostly medium- and low-priority polish/operations items.

## 2. What Is Working Well ✅

### SEO & Discoverability
- All public pages have unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags.
- Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags present on every page.
- `<link rel="canonical">` set correctly on all public pages.
- `robots.txt` correctly disallows `/admin.html` and points to `sitemap.xml`.
- `sitemap.xml` covers all key public pages with correct `lastmod`, `changefreq`, and `priority` values.
- Multilingual (`hreflang`) annotations implemented in the sitemap for English/Chinese page pairs.
- JSON-LD structured data (Restaurant schema) present on the homepage with address, coordinates, hours, telephone, and menu URL.
- Google Analytics 4 (`G-8LVTFZH7VD`) loaded on every page.
- Geo meta tags (`geo.region`, `geo.placename`) target Cape Coast, Ghana.

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- `manifest.json` defined with name, short name, theme colour, start URL, and display mode.
- Service worker (`sw.js`) pre-caches static assets and serves offline.
- Admin-specific service worker (`admin-sw.js`) isolated from the customer-facing cache.
- Firebase Cloud Messaging service worker (`firebase-messaging-sw.js`) registered for push notifications.

### Build & Performance
- Tailwind CSS is now generated via a local build step (`npm run build:css`), eliminating the unoptimised ~3 MB CDN bundle.
- Google Fonts `preconnect` hints (`fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com`) are present on every page, reducing render-blocking latency.
- Custom `404.html` error page exists and is wired into Firebase Hosting (`firebase.json` → `"404": "404.html"`), providing a branded not-found experience.
- `firebase.json` now includes `"site": "luban-workshop-restaurant"` in the hosting config, so `firebase deploy` always targets the correct Firebase Hosting site, eliminating any ambiguity in multi-site projects.
- A second Firebase Functions codebase (`luabn`) has been scaffolded in `firebase.json`; the entry point is currently empty and ready for future function additions.

### Security & Access Control
- Firebase Firestore Security Rules enforce role-based access: public read on menu/prices/images, authenticated-only order creation, admin-only reservation management and contact message reading.
- Two rules files provided: a development file (email-based fallback) and a hardened production file (Custom Claims only).
- Admin dashboard verifies admin status client-side before rendering and signs out unauthorised users automatically.
- Admin portal hidden from search engines and excluded from the PWA manifest scope.

### User Features
- Online ordering with cart, Firebase-backed order persistence, and real-time status updates.
- Table reservation form backed by Firestore.
- Contact form submitting to Firestore `contact_messages`.
- User authentication (email + password) with sign-up, sign-in, and password reset.
- Chinese-language versions of the homepage, menu, FAQ, privacy policy, contact page, events page, and about page.
- QR code assets and shareable flyer page for offline/print promotion.
- Team / About Us section with staff profile cards pulled from Firestore.
- SMS order confirmation sent to the customer immediately after an order is placed, and a follow-up SMS when the order status changes to "preparing" or "completed".

### Admin Features
- Menu management: add, edit, delete dishes; toggle visibility; override prices and images.
- Order management with real-time dashboard.
- Reservation management.
- Contact messages inbox.
- Admin user management (grant / revoke admin access via Firestore `admins` collection).
- SMS balance check endpoint (`checkSmsBalance` Cloud Function) accessible to admins via Firebase Auth token, exposing remaining Arkesel credit.

## 4. Next Steps

### Immediate (before next marketing push)

- [x] **Fix hours inconsistency** — `contact-us.html` Open Graph description now matches Mon–Fri 11:00–17:30. ✅
- [x] **Deploy production Firestore rules** — `firestore.rules.production` is now active in Firebase production. ✅
- [ ] **Set up Firebase Custom Claims** for the primary admin account (follow the steps in `FIRESTORE_RULES_README.md`).
- [x] **Add a `404.html` page** — branded not-found page created and configured in `firebase.json`. ✅
- [x] **Configure Firebase Hosting site name** — `"site": "luban-workshop-restaurant"` added to `firebase.json`; deploys now target the correct site. ✅

### Short-term (within 2 weeks)

- [x] ~~**Set `staff-guide.html` to noindex**~~ — page has been removed. ✅
- [x] **Update `sitemap.xml`** — added `about-us/profile.html`. ✅
- [x] **Fix JSON-LD `sameAs`** — Facebook and Instagram profile URLs added to the `sameAs` array on the homepage. ✅
- [x] **Fix `about-us/index.html` canonical** — canonical now correctly points to `https://lubanrestaurant.com/about-us/`. ✅
- [x] **Replace JPEG favicon** — `<link rel="icon">` now points to `logo.png` (PNG); `manifest.json` icons also updated to PNG. ✅
- [x] **Add Google Fonts preconnect hints** — `preconnect` hints added sitewide. ✅

### Medium-term (within 1 month)

- [x] **Introduce a build step** — Tailwind CLI build (`npm run build:css`) and esbuild JS bundling are wired into the build pipeline (`npm run build`); CSS and JS are now locally generated and purged. ✅
- [x] **Upgrade to modular Firebase SDK** — removed `firebase-*-compat.js`, added bundled modular Firebase bridge files, and wired JS bundling into the build/predeploy pipeline. ✅
- [ ] **Performance audit** — Lighthouse mobile run completed (`/index.html`: 60, `/menu.html`: 74). Lazy-loading and WebP hero image were applied, but additional optimization is still required to reach ≥ 90.
- [x] **Accessibility audit** — Lighthouse Accessibility was run across all pages and missing `aria-label` attributes were added to icon-only controls/links. Color contrast (`text-stone-400` → `text-stone-600`), FAQ accordion `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`, focus traps for all modals/drawers, and `lang` attribute on `drinks.html` have all been fixed. ✅

### Long-term (ongoing)

- [ ] **Set up Firebase Hosting via CI/CD** — add a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy on every push to `main`, so deployments are automated and auditable.
- [ ] **Implement Firebase App Check** — protect Firestore and Authentication from abuse by unauthorised clients.
- [ ] **Monitor Core Web Vitals** — use Google Search Console and GA4 to track real-user performance over time.
- [x] **Expand multilingual coverage** — Chinese pages now include `contact-us`, `events-and-catering`, and `about-us` in addition to the original set. ✅
- [ ] **Social media integration** — add verified social profile links, an Instagram feed widget, or a WhatsApp chat button to increase engagement.
- [x] **Email notifications for new orders/reservations** — Cloud Functions (`notifyOnNewOrder`, `notifyOnNewReservation`) now send SMTP notifications for new orders and reservations. ✅
- [x] **SMS notifications for new orders** — Cloud Functions (`sendSmsOnNewOrder`, `sendSmsOnOrderStatusUpdate`) send Arkesel SMS to the customer on order creation and on status changes to "preparing" / "completed"; a restaurant alert SMS is also sent on every new order. A `checkSmsBalance` HTTP endpoint lets admins verify remaining SMS credit. ✅
